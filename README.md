# Clustering
The goal of clustering is to find a natural grouping in data such that items in the same cluster are more similar to each other than those from diferent clusters. We will discuss one of the most popular clustering algorithms, Kmeans which is widely used in both academia and industry. Clustering (or cluster analysis) is a technique that allows us to find groups of similar objects, objects that are more related to each other than to objects in other groups. 

K-means is an iterative algorithm and it does  

1. Cluster assignment step: assign point which is closer to cluster point   

2. Move centroid step: move the centroid to the center of each cluster
